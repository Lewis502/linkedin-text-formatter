# Contributing

Thanks for your interest! A few quick guidelines:

## How to contribute
1. **Fork** the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-idea`
2. Make your changes.
3. Run a quick manual test (open `index.html` and try the toolbar & copy).
4. Commit with a clear message and open a **Pull Request** to `main`.

## Code style
- Keep the app zero‑dependency and client‑side only.
- Avoid heavy libraries; favor small, readable helpers.
- Keep accessibility in mind (focus states, contrast, aria labels).

## Issues
- Use GitHub Issues for bugs and feature requests.
- Please include reproduction steps, browser/OS info, and screenshots if helpful.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the MIT License.
